This is a sample document for testing the cosine similarity algorithm.
It contains various words that will be compared with another document.
The algorithm will extract these words and calculate their frequency.
Cosine similarity measures the angle between two document vectors.
A higher cosine similarity value indicates that the documents are more similar.
This document has some unique words that might not appear in the second document.
The implementation analyzes text data and provides a percentage similarity score.
