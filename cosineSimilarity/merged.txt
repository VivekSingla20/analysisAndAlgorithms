This is a sample document for testing the cosine similarity algorithm. It contains various words that will be compared with another document. The algorithm will extract these words and calculate their frequency. Cosine similarity measures the angle between two document vectors. A higher cosine similarity value indicates that the documents are more similar. This document has some unique words that might not appear in the second document. The implementation analyzes text data and provides a percentage similarity score. This is another sample document used for demonstrating cosine similarity. It shares some common words with the first document but also contains unique terms. The algorithm will compare how similar these two documents are. Text analysis is an important field in computer science and natural language processing. Cosine similarity is just one of many text similarity metrics. The angle between document vectors represents how closely related they are. When documents are identical, the cosine similarity equals 1 or 100 percent.
