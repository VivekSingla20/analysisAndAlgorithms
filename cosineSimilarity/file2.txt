This is another sample document used for demonstrating cosine similarity.
It shares some common words with the first document but also contains unique terms.
The algorithm will compare how similar these two documents are.
Text analysis is an important field in computer science and natural language processing.
Cosine similarity is just one of many text similarity metrics.
The angle between document vectors represents how closely related they are.
When documents are identical, the cosine similarity equals 1 or 100 percent.
